/**
 * The sketch is for communication between PC and any other device using Arduino Uno. With u-blox NEO-7M in the case.
 *
 * Because the Arduino Uno is used, which has only 1 USART, we have to deal with not quite stable `SoftwareSerial`
 * library. If there is one another hardware USART on your board, it's better to use it and replace `ss` with a
 * `Serial2`, for example.

 * u-blox NEO-7M - Arduino Uno
 * VCC - 5V
 * RX - 3
 * TX - 2
 * GND - GND
